        I‚Äôm editing old time entries form 1 year ago. For that, sometimes I need to change to another app to get some information about that date. When I change back to the worktimes app, it automatically returns to the current date, so I have to scroll back manually to the date I was editing and hope that I did not forget the information in the meantime so that I would have to change back to the other app (infinite loop üôÇ).
        
        As there is already a button to return to the current date, I don‚Äôt see much of a reason to change the shown date automatically when switching the app. My suggestion is to remove this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù or make it optional.
